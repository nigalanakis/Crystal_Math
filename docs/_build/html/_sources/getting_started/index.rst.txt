Getting Started
===============

Welcome to Crystal Structure Analysis (CSA)! This section will help you get up and running with CSA quickly and efficiently.

Overview
--------

CSA is a powerful framework for analyzing molecular crystal structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Whether you're studying polymorphism, intermolecular interactions, or crystal packing patterns, CSA provides the tools you need for comprehensive structural analysis.
