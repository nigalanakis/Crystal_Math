## Tools for systematic exploration of the molecular structures in the CSD databasetowards a topological based CSP

CrystalMath provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of molecular crystal structures from the CSD database and custom structures in the *.cif format. It offers deep insights into molecular packing trends, intermolecular interactions, and the topological nuances that dictate these patterns.

The algorithm begins with a systematic exploration of the CSD, extracting and analyzing topological and geometrical data. This method integrates a fundamental understanding that molecular crystals conform to specific geometrical constraints and topological patterns. Through statistical analysis, CrystalMath derives logical rules and predictive models that enhance our understanding of molecular structures.
